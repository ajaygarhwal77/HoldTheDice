            ðŸ‘‰ New Game: Once you click on new button the game will reset the score and the first turn for player will
            be
            choosed randomly.<br><br>ðŸ‘‰ A player can roll the dice as many times as he want but once he get 1 on the
            dice,
            his
            current score will become zero and the turn will go to the oponent.<br><br>ðŸ‘‰
            The main aim of a player is to reach to 100 total score.<br><br>ðŸ‘‰
            First you need to roll the dice and the number which u get on the dice will be added to your current score.
            If you think that you are satisified with your current score, then you can click on hold to add the current
            score to the total score and the turn will go to the oponent. If you are not satisified with your current
            score then you can roll the dice again
            but remember if you get 1 on the dice, your current score will be set to 0 and turn will go to the oponent.
